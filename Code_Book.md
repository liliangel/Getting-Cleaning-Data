# Code Book of Tidy_data Data Set.

### Tidy data is the result of raw data processing of Time and Frequency values measure to Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 
### 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
### In this data set, the values are the average of each variable for each activity  (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) and each subject
### (30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years). The names of following variables describe enough the measure.
